      <h2>I love Kerala</h2>

      <p>Kerala , known as Gods Own Country has some of the best tourist destinations in India for any kind of holiday. It is the land of coconuts, backwaters, elephants and the land of rich cultures and traditions, and has been one of the most sought after places by travelers from all around the world . Kerala Tourism was also recommended by Lonely Planet as one of the must visit family destinations to visit.

        It is without doubt one of the most beautiful places on earth and that’s why it is known as’Gods Own Country’. From the stunning beaches along the Malabar Coast to the maze of backwater canals cutting through huge rice fields to the glorious rolling hillside tea plantations in the Western Ghats, Kerala’s landscapes are almost as diverse as its people and the culture and history of the people of Kerala is a major factor in attracting the tourists</p>

      <h2>My own Thrissur</h2>
      <h5><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-time"></span> Post by John Doe, Sep 24, 2015.</h5>

      <p>Thrissur originally known as ‘Thirusivapperoor’ is the cultural capital of Kerala. Its cultural, religious and spiritual abundance has been historically recorded and is still preserved. The city is also denoted as the ‘Golden capital of Kerala’ because of the surprisingly high sales of gold happening here every year. In fact, there will be no other district in Kerala that would be doing consistently well in business over years. Talking about its cultural extravaganza, one must mention the mother of all poorams, the Thrissur pooram that is celebrated every year without fail. Held in April-May, Thrissur pooram is colorfully spectacular and pulls in a large number of tourists from all over the world to the city only to watch this festival.</p>
